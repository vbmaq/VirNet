This repository contains the code for creating the simulation pipeline, model training code, the trained model and code for evaluating the model on simulated and real images used and developed for the late-breaking work [Maquiling, V., Byrne, S.A., Nystr√∂m, M., Kasneci, E., & Niehorster, D.C. (accepted) V-ir-Net: A Novel Neural Network for Pupil and Corneal Reflection Detection trained on Simulated Light Distributions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3565066.3608690).

When using the code or model in this repository in your work, please cite Maquiling & Byrne, et al.
